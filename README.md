# Multilabel Classification 

## About the project
Experiments with localized versions of classification models to rapidly classify a poll response with a grade.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ is required.

### Installation
Clone the repository.

```git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git```

## Usage

To run the model, do the following:

Explanation of the output:
The project can be used by adding a rubric, the posed question, and the student response to the prompt. 
The output would be the model's feedback based on the grade received by the student.

## Roadmap

1. The project would assign a short-response a grade through a classification model and feedback through a large language model.
2. Some technologies that have been used so far are BigScience's BLOOM and NLTK. 
3. Future directions would include experimenting with classification models for deriving the grade and with prompt engineering in BLOOM to develop feedback.
