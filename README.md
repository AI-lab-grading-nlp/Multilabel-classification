# Multiclass Classification 

## About the project
Experiments with localized versions of AI models to find fast short-answer response grading and feedback methods.


## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Python 3.?? is required.
Make sure to install the requirements.

'''pip install -r requirements.txt'''

### Installation
Clone the repository.

'''git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git'''

## Usage

To run the model, do the following:

Explanation of the output:
The project can be used by adding a rubric, the posed question, and the student response to the prompt. 
The output would be the model's feedback based on the grade received by the student.

## Roadmap
\

1. The project would assign a short-response a grade through a classifying model and feedback through a large language model.
2. Some technologies that have been used are BigScience's BLOOM,
