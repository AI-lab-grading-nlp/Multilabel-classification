# Multilabel Classification 

## About the project
Experiments with localized versions of classification models to rapidly classify a poll response with a grade.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ is required.

### Installation
Clone the repository.

```git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git```

## Usage

The output would be the grade received by the student.

## Roadmap

1. The project would assign a short-response a grade through a classification model.
2. A technologies used so far is NLTK. 
3. Future directions would include experimenting with classification models for deriving the grade more accurately.
